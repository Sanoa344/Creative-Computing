 		<p> The user has invested so much real time and so many emotions on the web since the rise of social media that most people (at least in <em>first-world<em> countries) consider it a part of their real everyday life. The web has definitely gained more traffic due to Social Media as well, applications/websites such as facebook, instagram and twitter are designed to keep you wondering who is going to do what next? What shoe do I buy next? I think social media has done wondrs in connecting the world, yet I believe that social media plays a large role in  todays trend of the dumbing down of culture and subversion of anything with substance. <p>
