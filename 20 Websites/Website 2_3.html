    <h2>And the seven-stemmed flute she handed me.</h2>

    <h1>To me with smile she listened; and already gently</li>
    <h2>Along the openings echoing of the woods</li>
</ol>

    <h1>Was playing I with fingers tender:</li>
    <h2>And peaceful song of Phrygian shepherd.</li>

    <li>From morn till night in oak's dumb <em>shadow</em> </li>
    <li>And with sparing reward me gladdening</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Tossing back her curls from her forehead dear,</li>
    <li>From my hands the flute herself she took.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Now filled the wood was with breath divine</li>
    <li>And the heart with holy enchantment filled.</li>
