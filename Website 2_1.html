<ul> 
    <li>In the days of my youth she was fond of me,</li>
    <li>And the seven-stemmed flute she handed me.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
            <li>To me with smile she listened; and already gently</li>
            <li>Along the openings echoing of the woods</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Was playing I with fingers tender:</li>
    <li>And peaceful song of Phrygian shepherd.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
    <li>From morn till night in oak's dumb shadow</li>
    <li>And with sparing reward me gladdening</li>

</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Tossing back her curls from her forehead dear,</li>
    <li>From my hands the flute herself she took.</li>

</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Now filled the wood was with breath divine</li>
    <li>And the heart with holy enchantment filled.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
